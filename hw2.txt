The submission for homework 2 is in package entrants.pacman.yixing.
Uninformed Search: MyPacMan_BFS.java
Informed Search: MyPacMan_Astar.java
Helper Class: PathNode.java, GoalHelper.java

In the pac man game
Breadth-First Search:
Optimal: Yes. Because path cost is the same.
Time Complexity: O(b^d), every node has b successor nodes, and suppose it will expand d depth. And I implemented the goal test when selected for expansion.
Space Complexity: O(b^d).

A* Search:
Optimal: Yes. Because h(n) use Euclidean distance is consistent and admissible heuristic.
Time Complexity: O(b^(ed)), d is the solution depth, e is constant and b is the branching factor.
Space Complexity: O(b^d)

Compare:
Both Breadth-First search and A* search can get the optimal solution if the path cost is non decreasing. The time complexity and space complexity could use Big O notation to O(b^d). 
The different is Breadth-First search will selected nodes to expand in queue which means by nodes order. However, A* search at every time will select node n which has the lowest estimate cost. And the optimal path of this node has been found.
