Final Project Guided

I implemented Adaboost Algorithm and run the TensorFlow for neural network
The src of Final Project include 8 java class and 1 python file.

1. Adaboost Algorithm

For the data features extraction: MNISTReeader.java, HAARFeatureExtraction.java,
ImageFeatureExtraction.java

For the Adaboost algorithm: Node.java, ECOCStump.java

For the ECOC: Main.java, ECOC.java, DataInput.java

There is no pre-install pakcage. the MNIST dataset could be donwload from:
http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Step 1:
Run ImageFeatureExtraction.java to extract MNIST dataset features to create dataset with new features. It will create trainImage.txt and testImage.txt

Step 2:
Run Main.java to run ecoc with adaboost algorithm. The ecoc code book and predict train and test result will be created. And the accurancy of predict will be output. 

2. Neural network

This is a small convolutional neural network with using ReLU as nuerons

We use TensorFlow as tools to run it. The installation can be founded in:
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/get_started/os_setup.html#pip-installation

After finishing install it, could run the script in nn.py in terminal
